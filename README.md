# ToDo App with Bun.sh

Welcome to my ToDo App project where I'm experimenting with [Bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)!

## About the Project:

This project is a simple ToDo application built with Bun.sh, a minimalistic and easy-to-use task management tool. The goal is to explore the features of Bun.sh and create a basic ToDo app to manage tasks and stay organized.

## Features:

- **Task Creation**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as complete to keep track of your progress.
- **Task Deletion**: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Minimalistic Interface**: Enjoy a clean and straightforward user interface for efficient task management.
